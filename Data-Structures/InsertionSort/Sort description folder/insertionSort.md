# Insertion Sort

method to output the same array but by sorted numbers.

# Challenge
create method called insertionSort that returns the sorted arrays

# Approach & Efficiency
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
