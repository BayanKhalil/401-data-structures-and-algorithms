# pseudoQueue
You can create queue with two stacks

# Challenge

  this class will implement  queue , but will internally only utilize 2 Stacks
  
  # Approach & Efficiency
 
 1. enqueue, one can push a value directly to stack1.
 
 2. dequeue, the stack must be reversed,so a second stack is used to do this. Once the stack is reversed, 
 the top item is popped, then returning the item
