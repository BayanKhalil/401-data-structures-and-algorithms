# Graph


You can create Graph and manipulate it.

## Challenge

writing methods to add Vertex in the map, add Edges, remove both of them ,get the final size of your graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

* add node
this method will take Vertex as an argument ,Returns The added Vertex
Add a Vertex to the graph
* add edge
  this method will take 2 Vertex as an argument to be connected by the edge, 
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

* get nodes
  this method will take none argument
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection 
* get neighbors

Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

* size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
