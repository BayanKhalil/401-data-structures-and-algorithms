# Breadth First 



## Challenge

write the Breadth-First-Traversal  method on Graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

- initialize linkedList of string
- initialize queue
- add the root to queue
- then add it to linkedlist
- keep check if the queue is empty or not
- if not poll the data
- check if linkedlist has the data if not add it
- then add the new one in the queue
- go back to the while loop and so on

* Efficiency
  - time: O(n)
  - space:O(n)
