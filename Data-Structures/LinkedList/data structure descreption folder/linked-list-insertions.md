# Linked List Insertions


You can create Linked list and manipulate it by adding before and after a given node.

## Challenge

writing methods to insert value in the before and after the list, search on specific value then print the list as a string.

## Approach & Efficiency

the insert values in the before and after methods, will start from the head and search on the specific value, 
if it found it will add the new value before or after it.and the append method start from head and move forward 
then add the new value here.
