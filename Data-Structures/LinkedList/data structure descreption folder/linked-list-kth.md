# Linked List kth


You can create Linked list and get the value where places in k index from the tail of the linked list.

## Challenge

writing methods to get value places in k index from the tail of the list,then print the value.

## Approach & Efficiency

the kth method will initialize two pointer in head the second one will move forward until k-1,
and then both of them will move forward one step until second one reach to end of list ;
here the position of first one will be the value
