# max-tree
methods to find maximum value in the tree

# Challenge
create method in the Binary Tree Class that returns the maximum value stored in the tree

# Approach & Efficiency
The method is built using recursion to do a pre-order traversal of the tree.
and it has a moving pointer to move forward and check each node value to update its value to the highest one .
