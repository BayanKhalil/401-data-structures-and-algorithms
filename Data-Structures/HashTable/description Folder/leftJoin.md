# Left Join
methods that return list of one key with two value from two hashMap
# Challenge
write code to return list of key with join values for two hashMap

# Approach & Efficiency

write a method that accepts 2 hash maps as a parameter
Declare a list and iterate through each hashmap and compare the keys if it matches. If each hash map has the same key, then add the key and values to the list,
if not  add the second hash map value which is null.
