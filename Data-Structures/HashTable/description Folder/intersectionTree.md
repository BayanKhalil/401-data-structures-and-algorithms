# Intersection Tree
methods that return array of intersection element between two binary tree.
# Challenge
write code to return array of intersection element

# Approach & Efficiency

 Add all values from first tree into a hashmap
 then check to see if any of the values in the second tree are in the hashmap.
 If true, add values to a List and return the array 
 it will contain only values that exist in both trees
